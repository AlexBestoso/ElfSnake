# ElfSnake
C++ class for reading and manipulating Elf files

This is still a work in progress. 
Currently allows you to view Program headers, Elf header, and section headers.

String table is also usable.

Class automatically detects if a binary  is 32 or 64 bit and automatically uses the respective data types.
